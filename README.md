# Maven & Npm Version Bump Action

This project is a fork of [Maven Version Bump Action](https://github.com/nnichols/maven-version-bump-action).

A simple GitHub Actions to bump the version of Maven & Npm projects.

When triggered, this action will look at the commit message of HEAD~1 and determine if it contains one of `#major`, `#minor`, or `#patch` (in that order of precedence).
If true, it will use Maven to bump your pom's version and it will also use npm to bump your package's version.

For example, a `#minor` update to version `1.3.9` will result in the version changing to `1.4.0`.
The change will then be committed.

## Sample Usage
